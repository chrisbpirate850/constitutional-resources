2. How do we make sure our choices are fair to others?

**Real-Life Example:**
Imagine you and your brother both want to play with the same toy. Liberty means talking it out and taking turns‚Äîbecause fairness keeps freedom safe.

Draw a picture of a time you made a kind choice. Share your drawing with your family at dinner.
